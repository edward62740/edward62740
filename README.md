<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Edward</h1>
<h3 align="center">
  I am a PhD student at the College of Computing and Data Science, NTU (Singapore). <br>
  Broadly, my research interests are in efficient edge AI for vision tasks.<br><br>

<br>
ðŸ”­ Besides research, I also enjoy working on other projects (mainly in the intersection of hardware and software systems), including:

- Low-power IoT systems such as WSNs, native IPv6 networks
- Embedded and constrained AI, model compression and other efficiency-centered techniques
- Mixed signal and RF PCB design, 3D printed enclosures (for the above points)


ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m always open to collaboration on interesting projects, please drop me an email (edward[ $$\cdot$$ ]62740[ $$\alpha \tau$$ ]gmail[ $$\cdot$$ ]com). For formal communication, please see my site.
